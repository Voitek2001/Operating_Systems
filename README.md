# Operating System
### Wojciech Suski, 2022/23 summer semester Computer Science WIEiT AGH UST  

This repository focuses on the subject of Operating Systems, covering various aspects related to their structure and functions. It provides an in-depth exploration of the core concepts, including the kernel, process management, scheduling, process synchronization, inter-process communication, deadlock handling, memory management (virtual memory, paging, segmentation, and allocation strategies), linking (static and dynamic), I/O subsystem, file systems, and distributed operating systems.

# Goals  
The primary goals of this repository are to provide a comprehensive understanding of operating systems' structure and functions, from low-level kernel operations to higher-level memory management and distributed system concepts. It aims to equip learners with the knowledge required to design and develop efficient operating systems while addressing common challenges and concerns.
